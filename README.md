## About this repository

Explain your repository.

## Testing and Build (CI)

Proper testing is required in the pipeline.yaml and during deployments, in order to release
the application with reliability and be less prone to failures:Â 

- All categories should have **unit tests** when code is being developed and, [lint helm charts](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_lint), during pull requests.
- For categories 2, 3 and 4, [**postsync hook tests**](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/resource_hooks)
  are strongly advisable or even mandatory if the application can impact customers.
